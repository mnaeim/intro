# Intro to GitHub	 
Before understanding what GitHub is you should first understand what "Git" is? A "Git" is a version control system where you can record changes to a file or set of files overtime which makes it easier for developers to make new versions, it also keeps the old version in case you want to go back to the previous version or make comparison, for example: some developers managed to create a new application which needs constant changes to the codes to release new versions of it. The version control system store these modifications in a central repository so every developer can see these new changes, download them, and add to it.
	 
Most developers prefer Git rather than the other VCSs as it has a more advantages than the others. It includes more efficient way to store file changes and guaranteeing file integrity, in other words it makes sure to check-sum everything before it's stored just in case an error occurred in data entry or storage or transmission. The mechanism that Git uses for the check-summing is called a "SHA-1 hash" this is a 40 â€“ character string composed of hexadecimal characters (0-9 and a-f) and calculated based on the contents of a file.

## Git in GitHub 
Now, it's time to know what GitHub is! Git is a command-line tool in something called GitHub which is w website that developers can store their projects and network with other people. Basically, it's the center around which all things including "Git" rotate. GitHub contains a repository which is a location where all the documents and files for a certain project are stored, it's also usually called a "repo". Each project has its own repo which can be accessed and viewed by an exceptional URL. 

## Features 
One of the features that you can find on GitHub is called forking which means that for example: if you find a project on GitHub that you would like to add up to it and make changes and release as a new repo. Another Feature is called creating a "Pull request" which is used when you want your changes that you made to a particular project to be recognized by the original developers. AFTER creating the pull request you now reach the level where the original developers may OR may not accept your work.

Also, there is "Social Networking" which is considered one of the most powerful features of GitHub as this makes projects grow more than anything else. So each User on GitHub has their own profile which you can consider as a resume as it shows mostly everything about the user for example: your past work, Contributions to other projects via pull request, email addresses, you current location, name and picture. As well as, projects revisions are easily discussed publicly that allows a larger variety of experts to make changes, contribute knowledge and team-up to boost a project forward. Lastly, "Change logs" which is another feature that helps in keeping track of all the changes that have been pushed to the repo which makes it easier to know and keep track of who changed what and to easily seek the revisions that took place.

## Steps	
Finally, how to setup Git and GitHub with your computer "Windows"? Follow the steps:

1. Install Git
